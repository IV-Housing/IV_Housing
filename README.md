# IV Housing
* A web app that allows people to post lease offerings, communicate with potential leasers, and help people find potential roommates to live with
* Essentially, this would replace the UCSB housing facebook group, but more specialized to IV residents.
* We will be using Next.js as the tech stack

### Plan:
Two types of users, landlords that are able to post lease offerings on the site, and people looking for housing. Our minimum viable product will be a list of properties in Isla Vista, where landlords can update the availability of each individual property. In order to post any lease/sublease offerings or update the availability of a property users must create an account and login, but users that just want to browse properties will not have to login. Later on we plan on integrating a way for people to post sublease offerings as well.

### First Iteration of MVP:
* Narrow down to specific block/street: 66 Del Playa to start off small
* list all properties on 66 Del Playa w/ info
* user can sort by price per person/ size
