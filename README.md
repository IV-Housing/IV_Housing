# IV Housing
* A web app that allows people to post lease offerings, communicate with potential leasers, and help people find potential roommates to live with
* Essentially, this would replace the UCSB housing facebook group, but more specialized to IV residents.
* We will be using Next.js as the tech stack that we will be using
