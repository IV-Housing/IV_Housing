## Sprint Goal for 05/12-05/21
  
What worry about our product is keeping you up at night? What can we build or test this Sprint to make you sleep a bit better?
  
* Adding the range based filters for size and price
* adding tile view for house listings
* adding map page 
* adding login and create listing pages
* making the website more mobile responsive

We brainstormed user story ideas and discuess which ones each of us would like to work on for this iteration. All of those ideas went into our current to do list and the rest went into our final iteration to do list. 
  
## Discussion of previous Sprint Goal
  
Briefly: The previous sprint goal was a little bit ambitious and we did not finish all of the filters we wanted to. Inspite of this we did accomplish the main goals of our last sprint and got a very nice product put together that was about 90% of what we wanted.
