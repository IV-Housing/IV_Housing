## Brief description of MVP

(Describe what your MVP does for a user; set the expectations not too high and not too low. This should be written 
in informal language; the audience is someone, e.g. a fellow CS48 student, or any random UCSB student, that is going
to try out your MVP app.   Include everything they need to know, or a pointer to what they need to know, so that
they know what to do with your app.    For example, if the app plays the "mafia game" or "poker", include enough
detail of the game *or* a *link to a description of your game* so that a user will understand your app.)
